To continue our analysis, our team has decided to refine our models for ease of explanation/visualization and summarize our data to join with a secondary dataset. At the start of our project, we wanted to assess health trends over the course of the past two decades and check for health inequalities among races/ethnic groups. To accomplish this, we created two separate multiple linear regression models for systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). While this method was serviceable, working with two separate outcomes made our data difficult to visualize and model concisely. Thus, we’ve decided to change our outcome variable to mean arterial pressure (MAP), which is essentially a weighted average of the two values for blood pressure calculated with the formula MAP = DBP + 1/3(SBP-DBP) . Using this singular outcome allows us to convey the same information in a more compact manner. We also plan on adjusting this statistical model to treat “white” as the baseline for race/ethnicity to assess whether other races differ in health outcomes from white individuals. </p>

To further explore our regression model, we must visualize the coefficients of our dataset. We plan to create faceted plots with MAP on the y-axis and a single predictor on the x-axis. All other predictors will be held at a constant value. We will also bin the age variable to more easily work with the data, separating the variable into 18–39, 40–59, and 60 and over similar to a CDC data brief (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db289.htm#). We also plan on expanding our model through the addition of a secondary dataset. We have included information related to the percent of government spending on general health per year and plan to visualize and discuss our plots. Statistical analyses may not be feasible due to the small number of observations in our appended dataset (10 rows), so we will focus on creating visualizations.</p>

The results of our multiple linear regression have verified our initial hypothesis, so we plan on taking a deeper dive into this idea to flesh out and provide evidence for our thesis. Specifically, we claim that the outcome of blood pressure (MAP) is significantly associated with race/ethnicity and the year of data collection when corrected for other variables (age and gender). We plan to assess how population blood pressure levels have changed over time and analyze the effects of certain races/ethnic groups on MAP.</p>

For the polish and organizations for our visualizations and tables, our first main goal is to make our multiple regression tables as neat as possible, while maintaining the distinct order and characteristics of each graph. Most of our graphs consist of coefficients. </p>
We feel importance in age data, however it is not a time series data. So, for our graph does not imply any meaning in change in age trend, but only to time. </p>
One last graph that would enhance our project is regression before AND after the COVID pandemic. So, rather than just a simple regression or a bar graph, our group thought about high charters or apex charters along with the trend, in order to catch the distinct pattern through the cutting line of COVID pandemic declaration in the middle. </p>
Our visualizations with the secondary data should work as a control variable, where the audience would be able to see the effect of each factor of governmental health support to the public. For example, the map of US districts on country level and colored with its intensity of how much expenditure a.k.a governmental interest and care will be presented to each district. In this way on the interaction, people are able to use those data to apply to their own analysis on regression, and even possible to the Difference In Difference method or Regression Discontinuity Method, along with the main data of Blood Pressure. We thought TMAP would work in this case. However, not only to US public health expenditure, we would like to offer the analysis and maps of demographics as well. This is important since there might be a selection problem such as certain district has a big Silver Town -> county consists of high number of old people -> might display misleading information of higher mean blood pressure, etc. So, with the regression methods mentioned above, the audience would be able to interact even only with the data of demographics to secondary data and main NHANES data. </p>
