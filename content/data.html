<h2>Data Summary and Origin</h2>
<p>For our project, we set our sights on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset to help us profile different health trends. NHANES is a program designed and conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a branch of the Center of Disease Control (CDC). The program has surveyed around 5000 people as a nationally representative sample every year since 1999. The purpose of this study is to assess the general health, nutritional status, and prevalence/risk factors of disease in the population of adults and children in the United States through interview questions and laboratory exams. Interview questions seek to gather information related to demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related information. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by medical personnel. With this, we are able to find trends from health datasets throughout the last two decades.</p>
<p>To complement the health data provided by NHANES, we’ve decided to include a secondary dataset related to the allocation of United States government funds to healthcare from xthe World Bank website. The data is collected by the Development Data Group for the purpose of meeting demands of high quality statistical data for analysts around the world.</p>

<h2>Data Files and Relevant Variables</h2>
<p>Our group plans on using every NHANES dataset from 1999-2018 (ten collection cycles in total). For each data collection cycle, we used the singular dataset in the “Demographics Data” tab and the “Blood Pressure” dataset under the “Examination Data” tab. The data from the World Bank can be found in the website linked in the previous section. The dataset used by our group can be found on the right side of the webpage; simply click “CSV” under the section called “Download.”</p>
<p>The blood pressure dataset in NHANES consists of information related to blood pressure measurements and the manner in which they were taken such as what arm was used and substances consumed prior to examination. The specific variables used by our group were the first three readings for systolic and diastolic measurements of blood pressure named “BPXSY1(2,3)” and “BPXDI1(2,3).” The demographics data in NHANES consists of data related to individual demographics like education level, race, age, income, etc. Our models seek to specifically explore race (RIDRETH1), age (RIDAGEYR), and gender (RIAGENDR) as predictors of blood pressure.</p>
<p>The World Bank dataset consists of hundreds of variables related to the expenditures of the United States government. Each row is a variable, and each column is an observation within a given year, thus necessitating some cleaning. The specific row variable that we will use in our analysis is “SH.XPD.GHED.GE.ZS,” which lists the percent of government funds allocated toward general health by year.</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>A link to our load_and_clean_data.R file can be found here (this file is currently incomplete and subject to major changes). The NHANES data is only available in the SAS data format .XPT; thus, the “read_xpt()” function from the “haven” package was necessary to load the dataset into the R environment. The data was then written to a CSV file using “write_csv()” from the “tidyverse” package for a permanent conversion to a data file type more commonly used by R. The datasets were then loaded into the R environment using “read_csv().”</p>
<p>For the first step in data cleaning, the mean diastolic and systolic blood pressures of each individual was calculated and saved to a variable named “MeanDia” and “MeanSys” respectively. Then, a new variable called “MAP” was created using the formula MAP = MeanDia + ((MeanSys-MeanDia)/3) (not yet included in R file, but will be for final analyses). Following the creation of these variables, the BP data and demographics data was combined for each year using an “inner_join()” by “SEQN.” Following this joining, a new column called “Year” was added to each dataset corresponding to the year in which the data was collected. Lastly, each data frame corresponding to a cycle of NHANES was combined into a single data frame using “bind_rows()” that was then written to a CSV file. (will include code output in the final version here, but not yet complete).</p>
<p>The health expenditure dataset was loaded into the R environment using “read_csv()” and “filtered” to include only the row corresponding to “SH.XPD.GHED.GE.ZS.” To properly orient the dataset, “pivot_longer()” was used with values to “Health_Expenditure” and names to “Year.” The dataset was further “filtered” to include only the years 1999-2018, the years of NHANES collection used in our analysis. NHANES cycles usually occur over two years, so the values for expenses were averaged over every two years (i.e. 1999 and 2000 were averaged, 2001 and 2002 were averaged. etc.). To prepare the NHANES dataset for joining with the expenditure dataset, the NHANES dataset was summarized by the median MAP for each cycle. The expenditure dataset was then joined to the NHANES dataset by year. (once again, code output will be included here, but it’s not finished yet).</p>
